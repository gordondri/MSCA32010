# MSCA32010
Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis Course - Sep 2016 - Ded 2016 

This repository contains the final code for a project that was completed for the Linear Algebra course in the Master of Science in Analytics
graduate program at the University of Chicago. 

- The code was collaborated by Gordon Dri, John Navarro, Nathan Jensen, Taylor Marx, and Jack Balcarcel

The project entailed using a Markov Chain in the application of Monopoly to compute the probabilities of a player landing on a square at the steady-state
- A transition matrix was developed by calculating the probabilities of going from state i to state j based on the probabilities of rolling various combinations of two die (2 through 12). 
- Community chest cards and chance cards were factored in and the probabilities for these states were adjusted in the transition matrix 
accordingly 
- The steady-state (i.e probabilities of landing on all 40 squares of the board) was calculated by finding the basis of the nullspace
